# GMM_chlorophyll

This notebook will guide you through the process of applying a Gaussian Mixture Model to a set of oceanographic profiles. The code was designed for application to chlorophyll profiles, but places where you might want to make modifications for use with other profiles will be noted. This notebook will also allow you to make sample figures akin to those shown in Echols, Rocap, and Riser (in prep, 2021). 

This notebook reflects work done by Rosalind Echols as a PhD candidate at the University of Washington School of Oceanography.
